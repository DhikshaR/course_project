# Course Project

There are a large and rapidly growing number of remarkable applications of Computer Vision. From autonomous cars to smart manufacturing to augmented reality, inexpensive and ubiquitous cameras have made computer vision tools and techniques more relevant than ever. Cheap cameras and smart algorithms are empowering engineers to find creative solutions to important problems, provide real value to customers, and create products that simply could not have existed before.

As part of this course, students will work on a **real computer vision problem** as part of a semester-long group project. Projects will be broken into and evaluated on 6 milestones:

|         |   Milestone     | Description                 | Deliverable           | Due Date      | Resources    | 
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------   |
|    1    | Topic Selection | What CV problem will you go after?  | 1 paragraph writeup |    |    | 
|    2    | Customer Research | Who are your customers? Talk to them.| 3-5 page writeup summarizing customer interactions + learning | | |
|    3    | Literature Review + Competitive Analysis | What academeic literature and existing code/tools will help solve the problem for your customer? Who are your competitors? How does do their solutions work?| 3-5 page writeup | | |
|    4    | Technical Planning | How will you solve this problem? What tools will you use? How will you divide the work across your group? | 2 page planning document | | | 
|    5    | Technical Execution | Get to work! | none || |
|    6    | Final Pitch + MVP Demo | 10 minute presentation + demo of your technology to your peers  | Public Github repo with well-documented implementation of your solution, final presentation, and deliverables from previous milestones| | |

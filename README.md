# Course Project

There are a large and rapidly growing number of remarkable applications of Computer Vision. From autonomous cars to smart manufacturing to augmented reality, inexpensive and ubiquitous cameras have made computer vision tools and techniques more relevant than ever. Cheap cameras and smart algorithms are empowering engineers to find creative solutions to important problems, provide real value to customers, and create products that simply could not have existed before.

# Some Interesting Computer Vision Applications

# Mapillary

Mapillary is a service for crowdsourcing map photos and street view. Using simple tools like smartphones or action cameras anyone can collect photos that are combined into street view. Computer vision on the server-side automatically matches and combines photos across time and across users. Photos are processed with privacy preserving blurring using face detection and license plate detection.

# About the Course Project 

As part of this course, students work to build a solution to a **real computer vision problem** as part of a semester-long group project. The technology developed by the companies shown above is intended to show the broad range of possible computer vision applications, and give a little taste for what's happening in the industry right now. Of course, these companies have built some truly remarkable technology that will take longer than a single semester to implement. However, all these companies did start somewhere, likely with a simple demo, or **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. 

This is the project. Find a real problem, and create a MVP that provides real value /simple demo for someone. 


Projects will be broken into and evaluated on 6 milestones:

|         |   Milestone     | Description                 | Deliverable           | Due Date      | Resources    | 
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------   |
|    1    | Topic Selection | What CV problem will you go after?  | 1 paragraph writeup |    |    | 
|    2    | Customer Research | Who are your customers? Talk to them.| 3-5 page writeup summarizing customer interactions + learning | | |
|    3    | Literature Review + Competitive Analysis | What academeic literature and existing code/tools will help solve the problem for your customer? Who are your competitors? How does do their solutions work?| 3-5 page writeup | | |
|    4    | Technical Planning | How will you solve this problem? What tools will you use? How will you divide the work across your group? | 2 page planning document | | | 
|    5    | Technical Execution | Get to work! | none || |
|    6    | Final Pitch + MVP Demo | 10 minute presentation + demo of your technology to your peers  | Public Github repo with well-documented implementation of your solution, final presentation, and deliverables from previous milestones| | |

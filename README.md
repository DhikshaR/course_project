# Course Project

There are a large and rapidly growing number of remarkable applications of Computer Vision. From autonomous cars to smart manufacturing to augmented reality, inexpensive and ubiquitous cameras have made computer vision tools and techniques more relevant than ever. Cheap cameras and smart algorithms are empowering engineers to find creative solutions to important problems, provide real value to customers, and create products that simply could not have existed before.

# A Few Interesting Computer Vision Applications

# Mapillary 

![](graphics/github_lander_3.gif)

Mapillary is a service for crowdsourcing map photos and street view. Using simple tools like smartphones or action cameras anyone can collect photos that are combined into street view. Computer vision on the server-side automatically matches and combines photos across time and across users. Photos are processed with privacy preserving blurring using face detection and license plate detection.

# About the Course Project 

As part of this course, students work to build a solution to a **real computer vision problem** as part of a semester-long group project. The technology developed by the companies shown above is intended to show the broad range of possible computer vision applications, and give a little taste for what's happening in the industry right now. Of course, these companies have built some truly remarkable technology that will take longer than a single semester to implement. However, all these companies did start somewhere, likely with a simple demo, or **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. 

This is the project. Find a real problem, and create a MVP/Simple demo that provides real value for someone. 


Projects will be broken into and evaluated on 6 stages:

|         |   Stage     | Description                 | Deliverable           | Due Date      | Percent of Course Grade    | 
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------   |
|    1    | Topic Selection | What CV problem will you go after?  | 1 paragraph writeup |    |  5%  | 
|    2    | Customer Research | Who are your customers? (Talk to them for extra credit)| 3-5 page writeup summarizing customer research + learning | | 7.5% |
|    3    | Literature Review + Competitive Analysis | What academeic literature and existing code/tools will help solve the problem for your customer? Who are your competitors? How does do their solutions work?| 3-5 page writeup | | 7.5% |
|    4    | Technical Planning | How will you solve this problem? What tools will you use? How will you divide the work across your group? | 2 page planning document | | 5% | 
|    5    | Technical Execution | Get to work! | none || |
|    6    | Final Pitch + MVP Demo | 10 minute presentation + demo of your technology to your peers  | Public Github repo with well-documented implementation of your solution, final presentation, and deliverables from previous stages| | 15% |


## 1. Topic Selection
There are a huge number of interesting applications of computer vision. Good course project topics will meet a few criteria: 

1. Use image or video data as primary data source
2. Leverage Computer Vision algorithms on top of data
3. Provide value to someone

[Here are 50+ project ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ihH5_DdFyn5M0yv9maoYeqpiFoL4fL5jLYOeC4IgN0s/edit#gid=0)

Group + topic assignment details will be discussed in class. 

**Deliverables:**
A printed one page writeup with including your group member names, grad/undergrad status, a "primary contact" member of your group with phone number and email listed, a one-paragraph writeup of your chosen topic, and a proposed final technology demo. 


## 2. Customer Research
Here we will generally follow the [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) methodology. A nice summary of the relevant key ideas is Steve Blank's Customer Development Manifesto:

---

**A Startup Is a Temporary Organization Designed to Search for A Repeatable and Scalable Business Model**

1. There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get Outside
2. Pair Customer Development with Agile Development
3. Failure is an Integral Part of the Search
4. Make Continuous Iterations and Pivots
5. No Business Plan Survives First Contact with Customers So Use a Business Model Canvas
6. Design Experiments and Test to Validate Your Hypothesis
7. Agree on Market Type. It Changes Everything
8. Startup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing Companies
9. Fast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and Tempo
10. It's All About Passion
11. Startup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large Company's
12. Preserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.
13. Communicate and Share Learning
14. Customer Development Success Begins With Buy-In

To whom will you provide value? What problem will your Computer Vision solution solve, and for whom? What are their pain points?


**Extra Credit**


**Deliverables:**
Printed 3-5 page writeup summarizing customer research + learning. 

## 3. Literature Review + Competitive Analysis



## 4. Technical Planning



## 5. Technical Execution



## 6. Final Pitch + MVP Demo




# Industry Partnerships

![](graphics/old_charlotte_map.png)

Where possible, group projects will involve working directly with a local business or startup. Industry partners will select computer vision "side problems" or ideas that they find interesting but don't have time to explore, but could be relevant to thier business one day. Ideally, industry partners will meet with student groups 2-3 times throughout the semester to provide feedback + direction. When possible, partners may provide data for students to use. 

## Benefits to Industry Partners
- Groups may come up with interesting approaches that may be worth pursuing further
- Partners may identify well-qaulified potential interns or hires

## Benefits to Students
- Get work on a real problem
- A little guidance along the way
- Exposure to intersting places to potentially work
- A strong resume booster

## Expectations

Due to time constraints - this project is only one piece of one course - it's important to keep project expectations reasonable. These partnerships are far less extensive than, for example, industry-sponsored graduate level research. The hoped for outcomes here are outlined in the benefits above. Finally, by their very nature, many of these topics are relatively unexplored, meaning that good solutions may not be possible, especially in the course of a semester. This is what make entrepreneurship + research exciting, but also risky. One of the reasons this project is a semester long it to give you the time to pivot or change your scope if your first appraoch doesn't pan out.
